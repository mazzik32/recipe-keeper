## 1. Structure: The Only Framework You Need

### Above the Fold (0-3 seconds to hook them)
1. **Headline** → Single benefit, max 10 words
2. **Subheadline** → Clarify the "how" in 1 sentence
3. **Hero visual** → Product in action or outcome visualization
4. **Primary CTA** → Contrasting button, benefit-focused copy

### Below the Fold (Build conviction)
1. **Social proof strip** → Logos, ratings, or "trusted by X"
2. **Problem → Solution** → 3 pain points, your solution to each
3. **Benefits section** → 3-4 benefits with icons, not features
4. **Testimonials** → Real names, photos, specific results
5. **FAQ** → Objection handling disguised as Q&A
6. **Final CTA** → Same CTA as above, repeated

### What to Remove
- Navigation menu (84% of pages still have this—remove it)
- Social media links
- External links
- Multiple offers
- Sidebars

## 2. Copywriting: Rules That Convert

### Headlines
- **80% of visitors read only the headline**—spend 50% of your time here
- Use the formula: `[Outcome] + [Timeframe/Method] + [Without Pain Point]`
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Build Landing Pages That Convert in 30 Minutes"
  - ❌ "The Best Landing Page Builder on the Market"

### Body Copy
- Write at a **6th-grade reading level** (shorter = higher conversions)
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use "you" more than "we"
- Active voice only: "Get your report" not "Your report will be sent"

### The PRESTO Framework (use this)
1. **P**ain → State their problem
2. **R**esonate → Show you understand
3. **E**ducate → Explain the solution exists
4. **S**implify → Position your offer as the easy path
5. **T**estify → Social proof
6. **O**ffer → Clear CTA

### Copy Length
- **Short pages** (under 500 words): Free offers, simple products
- **Long pages** (1500+ words): High-ticket, complex, or skeptical audiences
- Rule: More expensive = more copy needed

---

## 3. CTA Buttons: The Details That Matter

### Copy
- ❌ Generic: "Submit", "Click Here", "Learn More"
- ✅ Value-driven: "Get My Free Guide", "Start Saving Today"
- **First-person increases clicks by 90%**: "Start my free trial" vs "Start your free trial"

### Design
- **Contrasting color** from the page (doesn't have to be red/orange)
- Minimum size: **44px height** on mobile (thumb-friendly)
- Rounded corners outperform sharp edges
- Add subtle hover animation (color shift, slight scale)

### Placement
- One above the fold (always)
- One at the bottom of each major section
- **Sticky CTA on mobile** (bottom of screen) → proven to increase conversions

### What to Add Near CTAs
- **Doubt removers**: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"
- **Social proof**: Small review widget (+68% conversions in tests)
- **Urgency** (if genuine): "Only 3 spots left", countdown timer (+9%)

## 4. Design & Visual Hierarchy (2025 Trends)

### Color Strategy
**2025 approach**: Limited palettes, strategic contrast

| Element | Color Strategy |
|---------|---------------|
| Background | Neutral/white or soft brand color |
| Text | High contrast (dark on light) |
| CTA Button | Contrasting accent (only element with this color) |
| Secondary elements | Muted versions of brand colors |

**Trending palettes**:
- Monochromatic (single hue, different shades)
- Muted/soft gradients
- High-contrast accents (dark navy + neon orange, soft backgrounds + bold CTAs)

### Typography
- **Max 2 font families** (1 for headlines, 1 for body)
- Headline: 40-60px desktop, 28-36px mobile
- Body: 16-18px minimum
- Line height: 1.5-1.7 for readability
- Generous spacing between sections

### Visuals
- **Illustrations > stock photos** (faster load, more unique)
- If using photos: real people, real expressions, looking toward CTA
- **Short-form video** (30-60 sec, TikTok-style) for product demos
- Micro-animations on CTAs and key elements (subtle, not distracting)

### Mobile-First (non-negotiable)
- Design mobile first, then scale up
- Larger tap targets (44px minimum)
- Sticky bottom CTA
- Collapsible sections to reduce scroll fatigue
- Test on actual devices, not just browser resize

---

## 5. Speed & Technical (Often Ignored, Huge Impact)

### Load Time Targets
- **Under 3 seconds** or you lose 40%+ of visitors
- Core Web Vitals compliance = better Google Ads Quality Score

### Quick Wins
- Compress images (WebP format)
- Lazy load below-fold content
- Replace auto-play videos with click-to-play
- Use SVGs for icons/illustrations
- Minimize third-party scripts

---

## 6. Trust & Social Proof

### What Works (in order of impact)
1. **Video testimonials** (even 20-30 seconds)
2. **Case studies** with specific numbers ("120% increase in...")
3. **Star ratings** from third parties (G2, Trustpilot, Capterra)
4. **Customer logos** (for B2B)
5. **Real-time activity** ("Sarah from Zürich just signed up")
6. **Trust badges** (SSL, payment security, GDPR compliant)

### Testimonial Format
- Full name + photo + role/company
- **Specific results**, not generic praise
- Place near CTAs and pricing

---

## 7. Forms: Less is More

### Field Count
- Every field you remove increases conversions
- **3 fields max** for lead gen (name, email, one qualifier)
- Multi-step forms outperform single long forms

### Design
- One column layout
- Inline validation (real-time error messages)
- Placeholder text + floating labels
- Large input fields on mobile
- Auto-focus on first field

---

## 8. AI & Personalization (2025 Standard)

### What's Working Now
- **Dynamic headlines** based on ad copy or referral source
- Personalized CTAs based on traffic source
- AI chatbots for instant objection handling (+20% sales)
- Smart routing to different page variants based on visitor behavior

### Tools to Consider
- Unbounce Smart Traffic (auto-routes to best variant)
- Dynamic text replacement (match ad keywords)
- Exit-intent personalization

---

## 9. Testing: What to A/B Test First

### High Impact (test these first)
1. Headline (biggest single factor)
2. CTA copy and color
3. Hero image/video
4. Social proof placement
5. Form length

### Testing Rules
- One variable at a time
- Wait for statistical significance (don't end early)
- Document everything
- Winner becomes the new control

## 10. Quick Audit Checklist

Run through this before launching:

## The Bottom Line

**Stop overcomplicating it.** The highest-converting pages in 2025:

1. Remove distractions ruthlessly
2. Lead with one clear benefit
3. Prove it with specific social proof
4. Make the CTA impossible to miss
5. Test, learn, iterate

Every element on your page should either build trust or drive toward the CTA. If it doesn't do either—delete it.
