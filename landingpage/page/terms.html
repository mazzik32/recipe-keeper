            <div class="updated">Last updated: March 2026</div>
        </header>

        <p>By using RecipeKeeper, you agree to these terms with visionite gmbh.</p>

        <h2>Service Overview</h2>
        <p>RecipeKeeper is a digital recipe management service that allows you to scan, store, organize, and share your
            personal recipes. The Service is available via our website and designated applications.</p>

        <h2>Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To access certain features of RecipeKeeper, you must create an account. You agree to provide accurate,
            current, and complete information during the registration process and to keep your account information
            updated.</p>

        <h2>User Content</h2>
        <p>You retain full ownership of the recipes, images, and text ("User Content") you upload to RecipeKeeper. By
            uploading User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, display, and
            process your content solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you (e.g., displaying your recipes
            on your device).</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights to upload any User Content and that its
            use by RecipeKeeper does not violate any third-party rights.</p>

        <h2>Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. This includes, but is not limited to: uploading illegal or harmful
            content, attempting to breach our security measures, or using the Service for any purpose other than
            personal use without our explicit consent.</p>

        <h2>License</h2>
        <p>For paid or free accounts, we grant you a personal, non-transferable, limited license to access and use the
            RecipeKeeper application for your personal use. You may not resell or redistribute your account access or
            license keys.</p>

        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>Paid upgrades and subscriptions are processed by our Merchant of Record. Checkout collects the email address
            needed to send your receipt and license key (or activation link). We do not store your payment card
            information.</p>

        <h2>License delivery</h2>
        <p>After payment, we email your license key and receipt to the address you provide at checkout. Please keep that
            email for your records.</p>

        <h2>License recovery</h2>
        <p>If you lose your license, we can resend it to the original purchase email after verifying the request.</p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>Refunds are provided at the sole discretion of visionite gmbh or its Merchant of Record and on a case-by-case
            basis and may be refused. We will refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or
            other manipulative behaviour that entitles us to counterclaim the refund.</p>
        <p>This does not affect your rights as a Consumer in relation to Products which are not as described, faulty or
            not fit for purpose.</p>

        <h2>Consumer Right to Cancel</h2>
        <p>If you are a Consumer and unless the below exception applies, you have the right to cancel this Agreement and
            return the Product within 14 days without giving any reason. The cancellation period will expire after 14
            days from the day after completion of the Transaction. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient
            that you send us your communication concerning your exercise of the cancellation right before the expiration
            of the 14 day period.</p>

        <p>To cancel your order, you must inform visionite gmbh or its assigned Merchant of Record of your decision. To
            ensure immediate processing, please do so by contacting us here. Please note that in respect of subscription
            services your right to cancel is only present following the initial subscription and not upon each automatic
            renewal.</p>

        <p>You also have the right to inform us using a model cancellation form or by making any other clear,
            unambiguous statement through our available communication channels. If you use our “Contact Us” form online,
            we will communicate acknowledgment of receipt of your cancellation request to you without delay.</p>

        <p><strong>Effect of Cancellation</strong><br>
            If you cancel this Agreement as permitted above, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you.
        </p>

        <p>We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are
            informed about your decision to cancel this Agreement.</p>

        <p>We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction and
            you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.</p>

        <p><strong>Exception to the Right to Cancel</strong><br>
            Your right as a Consumer to cancel your order does not apply to the supply of Digital Content that you have
            started to download, stream or otherwise acquire and to Products which you have had the benefit of.</p>

        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided “as is.” We strive for high availability but cannot guarantee that the Service will
            be uninterrupted or error-free due to maintenance or external factors.</p>
